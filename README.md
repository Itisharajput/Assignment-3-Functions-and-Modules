# Assignment 3 – Python Functions and Math Module

## Description

This assignment demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts such as
functions, recursion, conditional statements, and the built-in math module.
Special focus is given to input validation and exception handling to ensure
the program works correctly for valid inputs and handles edge cases gracefully.

## Tasks Included

### Task 1: Factorial Using Recursion
- Calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.
- Handles the base cases correctly for 0 and 1.
- Prevents factorial calculation for negative numbers.
- Uses try-except to handle invalid (non-integer) input.

### Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using math Module
- Calculates square root, logarithm, and sine of a given number.
- Uses absolute value for square root to avoid errors.
- Prevents calculation of logarithm for zero or negative numbers.
- Converts degree input to radians before calculating sine.
- Includes proper input validation and exception handling.

## Fixes and Improvements (Based on Mentor Feedback)

- Corrected the base case of the factorial function to handle both 0 and 1.
- Added input validation to restrict factorial calculation for negative numbers.
- Implemented try-except blocks to handle invalid user input safely.
- Added checks to prevent undefined operations such as log(0) or log of negative numbers.
- Fixed indentation issues to ensure all parts of the code execute correctly.
- Converted degree input into radians before applying the sine function.
- Added meaningful comments to improve code readability and understanding.

## How to Run the Program

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python file using the following command:

`bash
python assignment3.py
